this project is for health care pdf upload thing where user can upload pdf see it download it delete it everything simple way nothing fancy just basic work

frontend is react backend is express node and database is sqlite because easy to setup and i dont want heavy stuff uploads folder is where all pdfs go

to run the project first clone then go backend folder do npm install then npm start if port is busy then idk fix it somehow then go frontend folder do npm install npm run dev and then open browser and hope it works

api details are simple post slash documents slash upload for uploading pdf get slash documents for showing all documents get slash documents slash id for downloading delete slash documents slash id for removing file

issues are there like upload not working sometimes backend crash when filename strange ui not look good db entry little weird but ok for now

future maybe add login support more users cloud storage better ui maybe better code also because now code look little messy

If you want it even more brok
